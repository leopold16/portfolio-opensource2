        <h1>Espresso Teaching Website</h1>
        <p class="description">Group project for UI Design class, focused on teaching users how to make different types of espresso.</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was developed as part of a UI Design class. Working in a group, we created an interactive website aimed at coffee enthusiasts who want to learn how to make various types of espresso, including lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and more. The goal was to create an engaging and visually appealing experience for users, allowing them to easily follow along with instructions.</p>

            <h3>Design and Illustrations</h3>
            <p>Our team designed custom illustrations to visually represent each coffee type and its preparation steps. These illustrations played a crucial role in making the website more engaging and user-friendly. Each coffee drink has a unique illustration to guide users through the steps required to make it.</p>

            <h2>Project Video</h2>
            <p>We also created a demonstration video that showcases the website’s features and user flow. This video explains the website’s design and functionality, and provides an overview of the different types of espresso users can learn to make.</p>
